# UI-UX-Experiment1

## Aim:
To explore the Hands-on UI/UX Experiments

## Algorithm:
Learn the Basics Understand what UI (visual design) and UX (user experience) mean, and why both are important.

Use Real Examples Compare popular apps to see the difference between UI (look) and UX (feel).

Show the Connection Design a simple screen and test how UI changes affect the user experience.

Try Design Tools Practice with tools like Figma or Adobe XD to create and test your own designs

## Output:
[Exp 1 UIUX (1).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23587021/Exp.1.UIUX.1.pdf)

## Result:
Through these hands-on experiments, I developed a solid understanding of both UI and UX design principles. By analyzing real-world applications, I learned how good visual design (UI) must be paired with smooth user flows (UX) to create effective digital experiences. Using tools like Figma and Adobe XD, I created wireframes and prototypes, which helped me visualize how design decisions impact usability. These activities improved my design thinking, tool proficiency, and ability to evaluate and build better user-centered interfaces.
